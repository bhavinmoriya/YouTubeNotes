You're absolutely right! Let's rewrite the solution with proper LaTeX-style markdown for mathematical expressions. Here's the corrected version:

**Problem Statement:**

The simultaneous equations in \( x, y \),

\[
(\cos \theta) x - (\sin \theta) y = 2
\]
\[
(\sin \theta) x + (\cos \theta) y = 1
\]

are solvable:

(a) for all values of \( \theta \) in the range \( 0 \leq \theta < 2\pi \);

(b) except for one value of \( \theta \) in the range \( 0 \leq \theta < 2\pi \);

(c) except for two values of \( \theta \) in the range \( 0 \leq \theta < 2\pi \);

(d) except for three values of \( \theta \) in the range \( 0 \leq \theta < 2\pi \).

### Solution:

To determine for which values of \( \theta \) the system of equations is solvable, we analyze the determinant of the coefficient matrix. The system is solvable if and only if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is non-zero.

The coefficient matrix \( A \) is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta & -\sin \theta \\
\sin \theta & \cos \theta
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant of \( A \), denoted as \( \det(A) \), is:

\[
\det(A) = (\cos \theta)(\cos \theta) - (-\sin \theta)(\sin \theta) = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1
\]

Since \( \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1 \) for all \( \theta \), the determinant is always 1, which is non-zero.

**Conclusion:**

The system is solvable for all values of \( \theta \) in the range \( 0 \leq \theta < 2\pi \).

**Answer:** (a) for all values of \( \theta \) in the range \( 0 \leq \theta < 2\pi \).
