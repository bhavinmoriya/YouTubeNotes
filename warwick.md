To maximize \( a^2 b \) given \( a + b = 20 \) and \( a, b \) are positive integers, we can use a clever approach by leveraging **calculus and symmetry**.

---

### **Step 1: Express \( b \) in terms of \( a \)**
Since \( a + b = 20 \), we have:
\[
b = 20 - a
\]

---

### **Step 2: Formulate the expression to maximize**
We want to maximize:
\[
a^2 b = a^2 (20 - a)
\]

---

### **Step 3: Treat \( a \) as a continuous variable**
To find the maximum, we can treat \( a \) as a continuous variable and use calculus. Let:
\[
f(a) = a^2 (20 - a) = 20a^2 - a^3
\]

---

### **Step 4: Find the critical points**
Take the derivative of \( f(a) \) with respect to \( a \):
\[
f'(a) = 40a - 3a^2
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:
\[
40a - 3a^2 = 0
\]
\[
a(40 - 3a) = 0
\]

This gives us:
\[
a = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad a = \frac{40}{3} \approx 13.33
\]

Since \( a \) must be a positive integer, we check the values of \( a \) closest to \( 13.33 \), which are \( a = 13 \) and \( a = 14 \).

---

### **Step 5: Evaluate \( a^2 b \) for \( a = 13 \) and \( a = 14 \)**

- For \( a = 13 \):
  \[
  b = 20 - 13 = 7
  \]
  \[
  a^2 b = 13^2 \times 7 = 169 \times 7 = 1183
  \]

- For \( a = 14 \):
  \[
  b = 20 - 14 = 6
  \]
  \[
  a^2 b = 14^2 \times 6 = 196 \times 6 = 1176
  \]

---

### **Step 6: Compare the results**
The value of \( a^2 b \) is higher for \( a = 13 \) and \( b = 7 \):
\[
1183 > 1176
\]

---

### **Conclusion**
The maximum value of \( a^2 b \) is **1183**, achieved when \( a = 13 \) and \( b = 7 \).

\[
\boxed{1183}
\]
